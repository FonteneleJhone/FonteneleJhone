### Hi there, I'm Jhone Fontenele ðŸ‘‹

:brain: Electric Engineer and Industrial Automation Specialist.

I have been working for about 10 years with software development for industrial systems and controllers. Where I was able to design systems using `IIoT` technologies, such as `RFid`, `Industrial Wireless`, `Cloud platform` and `Condition Monitorig` with the main goal to integrate  `OT` and `IT` systems.  Using resources given by IT into industrial projects allowing relyable and easy integration between the factory(`OT`) and Control room(`IT`).

## Publication

In this paper, I was able to demonstrate how to integrate a Industrial machine with a IT system composed by database and dashboard in order to monitoring vibrations to predict possible breakdown through the machine behavior.
